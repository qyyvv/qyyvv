# Introduction
Hello, I'm [@rohanxs](https://github.com/rohanxs), a 16 year old developer living in the United States.

My interests in programming range from low-level C code to high-level Python-based applications as well as web development with JavaScript. Hope to contribute to open source.

# C/C++
Most of my C++ code is related to scientific/algorithmic computation. Though I don't often code at a systems level, I have some experience with the basics of
operating systems and memory management in C, though not much of these are uploaded as repositories.

# Python
I primarily use Python in development for building applications and software that work with external APIs or libraries. The bulk of the software I host on GitHub
is coded in Python. I'm also interested in machine learning and neural networks, particularly with `keras` and `scipy`.

# JavaScript
I've primarily used JavaScript in my projects to makeup for Python's shortcomings in web development simultaneously with HTML and CSS. I've also built a few web applications and web-embedded programs, and I hope to expand this knowledge to more advanced frameworks in the future.

# HTML/CSS
HTML and CSS are used in my projects along side other languages to build a website or platform of some sort for the software I create. I also built my personal website with HTML/CSS, though my web development experience isn't as in depth as I'd like it to be.
