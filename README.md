# Introduction
Hello, I'm [@qyyvv](https://github.com/qyyvv), a 16 year old developer living in the United States.

My interests in programming range from low-level C code to high-level Python-based applications as well as web development with JavaScript. Hope to contribute to open source.

# C/C++
Most of my C++ code is related to scientific/algorithmic computation. Though I don't often code at a systems level, I have some experience with the basics of
operating systems and memory management in C, though not much of these are uploaded as repositories.

Also happens to be my first (and my favorite) programming language.
```cpp
// the first program i ever wrote!
#include <iostream>
int main() {
    std::cout << "hello world!";
}
```

# Python
I primarily use Python in development for building applications and software that work with external APIs or libraries. The bulk of the software I host on GitHub
is coded in Python. I'm also interested in machine learning and neural networks, particularly with `keras` and `scipy`.

# JavaScript
I've primarily used JavaScript in my projects to makeup for Python's shortcomings in web development. I've built web applications and "bots" specifically
with the `discord.js` API, and I hope to expand this knowledge to more advanced frameworks in the future.
